Hello, I am Omotola!
I am an MSc Data Science graduate who is passionate about using data to improve products and solve complex problems. I have spent the past year building Fintech products as a Technical Product Manager while learning about machine learning modeling, big data analysis, image processing and cloud engineering.

I enjoy collaborating with developers, businesses and operations to deliver smart solutions to end users. 

I am serial learner, I find that ‘serial’ is the best word to describe the level to which I have taken the concept of learning so aside the above stated fields i have projects in various fields such as backend development with Django, Generative art using VQGAN and Clip in Python, Product Management in Fintech, Data analytics with Python and Tableau, Neural network, sentiment analysis and Deep learning.

When I am not studying or building, you can find me outside enjoying with friends.

You can use the links below to see what i have been working on!
