Hello, I am Omotola!
I am an MSc Data Science graduate who is passionate about using data to improve products and solve complex problems. I have spent the past year building Fintech products as a Technical Product Manager while learning about machine learning modeling, big data analysis, image processing and cloud engineering.

I enjoy collaborating with developers, businesses and operations to deliver smart solutions to end users. 

I am serial learner, I find that ‘serial’ is the best word to describe the level to which I have taken the concept of learning so aside the above stated fields i have projects in various fields such as backend development with Django, Generative art using VQGAN and Clip in Python, Product Management in Fintech, Data analytics with Python and Tableau, Neural network, sentiment analysis and Deep learning.

When I am not studying or building, you can find me outside enjoying with friends.

You can use the links below to see what i have been working on!

* DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONS

        * Movie Lens Dataset:- Uses the MovieLens data set to create a network visualization to help understand user-user 
          relationships and Movie-Movie relationships.The output should be a nice network graph visualization that individuals can interact . Ideally   
          the result should show movies which are similar to each other but isolated from the rest of the movies and a similar thing for users. The work 
          was done to support a recommender system project.

        * Analysis-of-CFPB-Consumer-Complaint-Database-uisng-Big-Query-and-Looker:- The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about 
          consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response.This project analyses the database using SQL and \
          visualizations.

        * Web-Scraping-and-Analysis-of-Competition-Press-Release-Sentiment-and-Word-Cloud-Analysis:- The datasets provided contains scraped press 
          releases from the European Commission. The files contain search results for the search term “competition”. Each file had at least 2,500 
          scraped html. The goal of this project is to: Compile data into a single clean dataset containing the content from all press releases and any 
          relevant associated metadata.
          Descriptive analysis of the dataset:To answer the hypothesis question; is data and technology becoming more important in the EC’s competition 
          enforcement?
          Lastly, to identify potential areas of improvement and further analysis

        * Visualization of Chemical Contamination in Boonsong Lekagul waterways:- This project analysis the changes and level of chemical contamination 
          causes by production companies in a given geographical location.

 * MACHINE LEARNING 
 
        * Sentiment-analysis-and-modelling-of-Twitter-data---US-2020-Presidential-election:- We explore sentiment classification with a systematic 
          approach: the task is three-class positive/neutral/negative classification, the text being analysed is not a random text document but rather 
          directed towards a political topic. A series of three-class sentiment analysis classification was conducted on a set of 7,000 tweets produced 
          during the run-up to the United States Presidential election held in November 2020 achieves 92% accuracy using supervised learning and a 
          recurrent artificial neural network.

        * STUDY-OF-TWITTER-INFLUENCE-ON-NFT-COLLECTIONS-MARKET-PERFORMANCE-USING-LSTM:- The analysis of the NFT marketplace and blockchain data is in 
          its nascent stage with a lot of answers that can be provided with the use of data science. This project creates a first-of-its-kind dataset 
          linking Twitter, OpenSea and Etherscan (Ethereum blockchain) to capture social media profiles, linked NFT collections and blockchain 
          transactions of each collection’s address. The project applies deep learning models to understand the correlation between an NFT collection 
          popularity on twitter and its valuation and volume of biddings in the NFT marketplace.(Private Project)
          
        * Exploring Various Machine Learning Models on a Genomic Dataset:- This project is about developing a supervised learning model on a genomic 
          dataset. The dataset contains data about patients admitted in hospitals to treat COVID-19 cases. Some patients had a mild infection, while 
          others had a severe one. The goal of this project is to build a supervised learning model to predict severe COVID-19 hospital admissions by 
          using the genome sequencing of patients as predictors.
